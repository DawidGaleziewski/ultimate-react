# fetching data

Native fetch communication is ok but we will use axios

# axios

Benefit of axios is that:

- it supports wide area fo browsers
- it is promise based
- makes error handling easier
- axios is lightweight and wont add much to the app

npm install axios --save

# Container:

we will start coding from the container

# List

As server return now the id, it is a good idea to use id in list key
key={id.toString()}
