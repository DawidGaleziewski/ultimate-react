#Components
    *why we use those?
        -If we have many components we do not want the javascript to be to much tangled. That will help use change one component in the future without affecting the rest of them
        
        -If we have one component repeated multiple times

        -We build individual 'bricks' of the application and then we build the whole out of it

Individual component will have:
    -view
    -code - actions anf functionalities like login into a system
    -Communications interface - the components need to comunicate together
    -Logical unit - they need to be individual instances
