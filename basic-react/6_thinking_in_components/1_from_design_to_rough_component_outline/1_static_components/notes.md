# 1. Look at design and think before hacking

- What compnents can we see?
- What components could be re-used?

i.e:

1.container--header
1.a | header
1.a.a |section 1 -- form
1.a.b |section 2 -- List

# 2. Build a static view first without state or interaction!

- For sttyling we will need installing node-sass
  npm install node-sass --save-dev
